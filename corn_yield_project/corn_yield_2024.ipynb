    "This script aims at **forecasting the 2024 U.S. national corn yield (bu/acre)** using historical USDA yield data and provided weather data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The corn data are obtained with API and downloaded automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only the category \"ALL PRODUCTION PRACTICES\" (see USDA agric. database website) has been considered (thus there is no difference between irrigated and non-irrigated fields). --> The model could be relaxed to actually discriminate between the two cases, as we expect different weather features to be important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only the counties for which the weather was available have been considered in the model. As a next step for including the other counties there is a first easy move:\n",
    "We can look for the trend of each of these counties (or aggregated counties under the name of \"OTHER (AGGREGATE)\" under the USDA data) and then we can model the remaining fluctuations as a random walk.\n",
    "We can then do some quick Monte Carlo modeling for including these counties in the forecast.\n",
    "However, I expect the weight of these datasets to be small as otherwise they would not be aggregated. Furthermore, if counties are far away (especially in big states) a real modeling would be complicated as each underlying random process could mix and be undetectable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before developing any model I find very constructive and insightful to look at the data and perform some correlations to have a first hint. I started comparing the corn yield among different states.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first interesting result is that the standard deviation can be extremely different among the different states. An example is **Ohio** and **South Dakota**. Thus it appeared clear that probably each state must be modeled independently to reduce the variance of the prediction. Thus I have done some weather plots for Ohio and South Dakota to see if already graphically it was easy to detect the differences. [*some weather considerations..*]\n",
    "\n",
    "After this first investigation, I focused on **feature engineering** and **corn data transformation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular from the weather dataset I extracted some values that could be relevant for the corn yield modeling. The list of these features is in the first cell of the notebook. Some of the features are the **maximum continus days without rains**, the **max temperature in the month**, **very cold day** (T<-5 degree>) and **very hot days** (T>35 degrees) and I selected them due to the previous observations and differences between Ohio and South Dakota.\n",
    "\n",
    "For what concerns the modeling of the corn yield, it is done essentially in a few steps. After looking at the simple plot corn yield versus time it appeared clear they have a strong trend. The first assumption here is that the trend does not depend on the weather. This is reasonable given the huge growth of corn yield cannot be justified with weather. Thus, as first thing I estimated the trend for each county.\n",
    "\n",
    "My idea (motivated by the fact that such feature is quite common in time series) is that this growth is due to investments and technology. More corn yield leads to more investments and more than a linear trend is expected. Thus the **first transformation** that I have applied to the data is a **logarithmic** one. After the log transform there is still some trend that can has also been removed. However, to **remove the additional trend** I only took the data compatible with the weather data I had at my disposal. I have done this because forecast models work well with stationary data. Thus I wanted stationary data for the available dataset (i.e. weather dataset after 2000s) I could use to train my models.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the computation of the aggregated features (max number of days without rain, number of hot (T>35) days etc...), I have performed **correlation** plots between corn yield and each of these features for every month. These plots revealed something extremely useful. The correlation, for each feature, is a cyclic function of time (it is obvious that correlation in December must be similar to the one in January but it is still a good safety check) and the **peak of correlation** (or anti-correlation) for almost all features is reached during **summer between May and August**. This is very clear for the plot obtained including the whole weather dataset (i.e. the data are not filtered per state or county) but it is also clear in the individual plots of single states (except Minnesota whose plot looks very noisy).\n",
    "\n",
    "The correlation plot shows that precipitation, soil water content and soil water content standard deviation are positively correlated with corn yield during summer, while extreme temperatures (very hot days or maximum temperatures) are negatively correlated with corn yield during summer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately this plot tells us something important: the crucial weather data to have good forecasts are between May and August. This means that with our dataset we cannot do reliable 2024 corn yield prediction as our 2024 weather data stop at the end of April. To include this information in our data forecast we should heavily increase the error bars (or variance or confidence range) compared to the simple confidence interval we have from our modeling. In this assignment, this is not included thus we should be less confident in our forecast compared to what data tell us. One could include this assessment by training the model with the full year weather for past years and then to do the same with just the data we have to estimate our 2024 corn yield, that is data until April. Then one could compute how much is the difference for example compared to real values of 2021, 2022 and 2023 between the two models and the real corn yield value. I did not do it myself but it should be doable with this notebook modifying the parameters in the first cell. I have only done the prediction for **2023** and it looks **very good (error of prediction of 1%)** when full year is included, especially with the random forest model. This can be done putting YEAR_PREDICTION to 2023 and month range (5,8) -it is enough-.\n",
    "\n",
    "To actualy show that the model is betteer than a simple fit, next to the prediction for 2024 there is the prediction for the year **2012**. I chose this year since it goes outsite the linear fit and it has a strong drop compared to 2011 and 2013. The random forest model is actually capable of predicting the drop as you can see from the picture. For this plot I did not retrain the model so the model has seen partially the data during trainig, but the match is nonetheless very good and it stresses that the random forrest is doing a very good job.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us go to the more quantitative part:\n",
    "\n",
    "The models developed in this notebook start from data of each single county. The idea is to **model the corn yield of each county for 2024 and then to weight them** (the weight is the relative harvested area with respect to the total) for the final national corn yield prediction. Indeed from the plots drawn below it is clear that there are counties with very different areas (making some almost negligible for national corn yield).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here there is again some space for model improvement. Indeed during the training of our models all counties are treated in the same way, one could think of a customized loss function where more importance is given to data belonging to counties with large harvested areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further improvement could also be achieved with a model for the harvested areas. In this assignment I focused only on the yield, but one could apply similar modeling (using other datasets - not weather) for the harvested areas. Not all areas are available for 2024 thus we have to make some choice. There are **two possibilities** in the notebook for what concerns the **area** to use for the weight of the forecast:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The last available area for the counties\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The average of the data after the year 2000 (to be coherent with the rest of the modeling)\n",
    "\n",
    "***Thus learning process happens on this transformed dataset and then the predicted values are re-transformed*** (in the opposite order) to go back to real values. In the evaluation of the uncertainty parameters I did not include also the uncertainty of the trend, but for a correct modeling this should be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment I mostly focused on the modeling part, not on the efficiency of the models nor on the exploitation of the models. I am sure that given the two models here one could play with additional aggregated weather features and with some other parameters (i.e. tuning harvested areas, including other counties, changing parameters of the models and so on) to obtain more precise forecasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The models used to give a quantitative estimation for 2024 are two:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Random Forest** (using scikit-learn)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Multi Layer Perceptron** (Neural Network with Pytorch)\n",
    "\n",
    "They are both very simple, and yet they give reasonable forecasts. Both of them could be further tuned even though I did not spend time trying to optimize the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step to improve, the random forrest could take as input the number of trees depending by the number of input features (now it is fixed thus it is not optimal for the case with monthly aggregated data)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are dealing with time series, another possible extension of this work could be the possibility of using different NN architectures that are more appropriate to model time series such as LSTM or the time-series version of Transformer. The latter could also give information about which hidden parameters are most critical thanks to the \"attention\" mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have also started to implement the probabilistic multilayer perceptron, and this is something I would finish in the future - it does not differ much from the simple MLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another simple option would be to perform a Bayesian regression, however it could be demanding with many dimensions (i.e. all weather features) thus I disregarded it at first.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is logically divided in three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Data engineering**\\\n",
    "In this first part weather data are loaded, the corn data are downloaded with an API (be sure the internet connection is fine and the API_KEY works), and there is some data manipulation for ordering correctly the data for the visualization and some checks between API downloaded data and manually downloaded data - the part is commented out since you need the file to load but you can still see the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Data exploration**\\\n",
    "In this part there is some exploration of data done plotting several quantities to understand where and how to start the modeling. Some parameters as temperature, precipitation and soil moisture are plotted for states with very different corn yield. The goal was to see if already visually when comparing different locations with very different yield simple plots can already be inspiring. From those, one can target better subsequent analysis.\\\n",
    "After, there is the calculation of weather aggregated quantities. In particular I have computed: tmax_mean, tmax_min, tmax_max, tmin_mean, tmin_max, tmin_min, tmin_std, precip_max, precip_std, precip_mean, swvl2_min, swvl2_mean, swvl2_std, hot_day (days where temperature is above 35 degrees), cold_day (days where temperature is below -5), max_cons_dry_days (maximum consecutive number of days without rain).\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Modelling and prediction**\\\n",
    "In this part there is the modeling for the training algorithms. There is first the random forest, with training and prediction. Then there is the Neural Network with the training and prediction.\n",
    "The random forest is trained twice and it generates two predictions. The first includes only the yearly aggregated features (but including only the months between January and April) and the second one includes monthly aggregated features (thus 4 times more data than the yearly aggregated case). The Neural Network is trained only on the monthly aggregated data. Both the models give very similar results, with a slight overestimation of the 2023 value (when the input YEAR_PREDICTION is set to 2023) of about 2%. However, training the random forest with the relevant weather dataset for July (i.e. taking weather data from May to August), the model perfectly finds the right 2023 value.\n",
    "The confidence level in both models is about 8% of the mean value, i.e. data are supposed to fall inside 195 (mean value predicted 2024) ±10/15. The predicted value is very similar for both the random forest and the NN.\n",
    "The NN has been trained with the data of the whole nation together, and it could be better tuned if it was trained state-by-state. Indeed with the random forest I show that the mean root square error is 0.15 when the whole data are trained together and 0.13 when it is trained state-by-state. I expect a similar improvement to occur also for the NN.\n",
